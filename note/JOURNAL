## **Entry 1: Memories of Innocence**
### *Undated - Written in Reflection*

There's something magical about childhood friendships, isn't there? When I think back to 2nd or 3rd grade, I can still see her clearly—the moment she shifted just a few steps away from my home. We were inseparable from that day onwards. Every afternoon after school, every weekend, we were together. Langdi, Lagori, badminton, cricket... we played everything. We were two kids with nothing but time and imagination, creating memories without even knowing they would matter so much later.

I remember those mornings before school, waiting for the van in our uniforms, and somehow we'd find time to play that one game—Langdi. Just the two of us. I wonder if she remembers those moments the way I do. Probably not. For her, those were just regular days. For me now, they're chapters of a story I can't stop rereading.

Those were the days when life was simple. Friendship was pure. No complications. No feelings. Just two kids being kids.

## **Entry 2: The First Realization**
### *Late 2019 - 6th Class Era*

Something shifted inside me, and I didn't understand it at first.

We were still friends, still playing together, but one day I caught myself thinking about her differently. It started small—a random thought here, a lingering feeling there. At first, I tried to push it away. I told myself, "She's just a friend. Why am I thinking like this? What's wrong with me?" I was confused and conflicted. How could my best friend suddenly be the person I couldn't stop thinking about?

I kept this to myself. I continued playing with her, laughing with her, but now there was a new layer underneath—a consciousness I couldn't shake. I liked her. Actually liked her. And I was terrified of what that meant.

I never showed it. Or at least, I thought I didn't.

## **Entry 3: The Sign**
### *Early 2020 - A Moment That Changed Everything*

This is going to sound strange, but I believe in signs now. I didn't before, but I do now.

After months of having these feelings—these confusing, all-consuming thoughts about her—I was walking somewhere, thinking about her like I always did. Random thoughts, you know? Just her face, her laugh, the way she moved. And then, like something out of a movie, there she was. In front of me. Real. Not a thought anymore.

She was standing with her parents eating Pani-Puri at a roadside stall. We locked eyes for just a moment. I felt the universe shift.

I know how this sounds. I know people will say it's coincidence. But for me, in that moment, it felt like destiny. It felt like proof that there was something between us. Something real. Something beyond friendship.

That day, I stopped questioning my feelings. I accepted them. She was going to be important to me—I just knew it somehow.

## **Entry 4: The Garba Night - Everything Changes**
### *2021 - 9th Class, Navratri Celebrations*

Tonight changed my life.

Our neighborhood organized Garba for the first time, and our whole friend group was involved. It was new for me—I'm not a dancer, never have been—but we all practiced together for 7-8 days before the main event. It was fun, chaotic, and full of laughter. She was there every day, and somehow practicing with her made me want to be better at it.

But then came the main night.

She walked out wearing her Garba attire, and I forgot how to breathe. I'm not exaggerating—I literally couldn't process what I was seeing. I'd seen her countless times before, but something was different tonight. She was radiant. She was glowing. She was absolutely, devastatingly beautiful, and in that moment, every feeling I'd ever had for her crystallized into something undeniable.

This wasn't a crush anymore. This was love. Pure, absolute, consuming love.

From that night onwards, she became my entire world. Every thought, every dream, every future I imagined—she was in it. No other girl existed for me. I didn't see anyone else. How could I? She was the first, and I knew with absolute certainty that she would be the last.

Whenever I would see her after that, my heart would race uncontrollably. My stress levels would spike. I'd get so shy and nervous. But she had no idea what was happening inside me. I was carrying this massive love in my chest, and she had no clue.

I was completely, hopelessly fallen. And it felt both like the best and worst thing that had ever happened to me.

## **Entry 5: Fantasy and Planning**
### *2021-2022 - The Dream Phase*

I've spent countless nights lying awake, creating scenarios in my mind. How would I tell her? What would I say? How would I propose? I imagined it all—every word, every moment, every possible outcome. I made elaborate plans in my head, running through them over and over again until they felt real.

Sometimes the scenarios ended perfectly—she'd smile and say yes, and we'd be together forever. Sometimes they ended in rejection, and I'd have to live with that. But I kept dreaming anyway, because dreaming was safer than doing.

I became obsessed with the idea of a future with her. I couldn't help it. Every plan I made, every goal I set, somehow included her. She became my reason for everything. My motivation. My dream. My entire fantasy.

I told no one. I carried this alone, replaying conversations we'd never had, imagining futures that didn't exist yet.

## **Entry 6: The Unexpected Push**
### *2023 - 11th Class, Coaching Days*

Fate works in strange ways, doesn't it?

I didn't want to join coaching with VJ—he was irritating, annoying, the kind of friend who made everything chaotic. But I had to for JEE preparation. I genuinely dreaded it. Looking back now, I realize I was so, so wrong to make that choice. Not because of the coaching, but because of what happened after.

She joined the same coaching.

VJ found out about my feelings—I don't even remember how he discovered it, but he did. And then he started threatening me. Every single day. "I'll tell her," he'd say, with this infuriating smile. "I'll tell her everything." At first, I'd panic. "No, please don't! VJ, don't do this!" But after a while, the threats became so constant that I just stopped reacting. I learned to ignore them, to act like it didn't matter.

Except it mattered. It mattered so much.

And then one day, VJ walked up to me and said casually, as if he hadn't just destroyed my carefully built world: "I told her. She knows about your feelings. She wants to meet you. From her terrace. You'll meet from yours."

My entire body went cold. Years of careful planning, of fantasies and scenarios—and it was all being forced into reality in the span of a sentence. I wasn't ready. I didn't have the perfect words anymore. I was just... terrified.

But I went anyway.

## **Entry 7: The Terrace Moment**
### *2023 - First Meeting After Revelation*

I climbed up to the terrace with so much fear and so much hope that I could barely move. I was shaking. I couldn't do this alone. So I made VJ come with me—I know, I know, not the most romantic setup for a life-changing moment, but I was desperate for the courage his presence gave me.

I saw her standing there, and I was so shy I could barely meet her eyes. So I did the only thing that came to mind—I took her hand and pointed to each digit of my phone number on my fingers, signing it silently. It sounds ridiculous now, but it was all I could manage.

She called me that night, and we talked. I don't remember exactly what we said—I was so overwhelmed that most of it is a blur. But I remember feeling like my entire life had been leading to that conversation.

When we said goodbye and went back down from that terrace, everything had changed. We had crossed a line from friendship into something undefined. Something terrifying. Something beautiful.

## **Entry 8: The Instagram Saga**
### *Late 2023 - A Year of Growing Closer*

After that terrace moment, we started talking every day. It became our routine. Then it became our life. But there's something complicated I need to write about here because I can't tell this story without acknowledging it.

She had another account on Instagram—and she used it to impersonate someone. I didn't know it was her at the time. This other girl account approached me, said she had feelings for me, wanted to be with me. I rejected her immediately. How could I say yes to anyone else when Rhea consumed every part of my brain?

But then VJ told Rhea what had happened. And here's where it gets messy—she literally became that girl. She was the one who had approached me, testing me, seeing if I would fall for someone else. The girl I was defending against online was actually her all along.

I was angry at her for the deception. I blocked her, unfollowed her, cut off contact. I was so frustrated and hurt that she would do this to me. But she revealed her true identity, explained everything, and eventually, I understood. She was testing me. She wanted to know if she was the only one in my heart.

She was. She is.

## **Entry 9: The Flirtation Phase**
### *Early 2024 - Six to Eight Months of Bliss*

For the first time in years, I felt like maybe, just maybe, this could actually happen. We were talking constantly. Hours and hours of conversations. And then it happened—she started flirting with me.

Casually. Unexpectedly. And it sent me into absolute madness.

I lost all control. I started flirting back, and suddenly we weren't just best friends talking—we were two people actively trying to make each other feel something. It was electric. It was everything I'd dreamed about. Every conversation felt charged with possibility. Every emoji felt like a promise.

This went on for six to eight months. Six to eight months where I finally felt like the universe had heard my prayers. She was meeting me halfway. She was actually reciprocating something. I wasn't crazy for feeling all of this. She felt it too.

Or so I thought.

## **Entry 10: The Collapse**
### *Mid-2024 - "You Deserve Better"*

I don't know how to write about this part. But I have to, because this is the part that broke me.

After months of constant talking, of flirting, of imagining a future together, she sent me those words: "You deserve better."

Four words. That's all it took to shatter me completely.

In that moment, I lost everything. My sanity. My focus. My sense of self. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't study. I couldn't sit still. I couldn't think about anything except what I'd done wrong, how I'd failed her, why I wasn't enough.

I wasn't angry at her—I was so, so angry at myself. I cried every single day and night, replaying our conversations, trying to find the moment where everything went wrong. What did I do? Why did she leave? Was I not good enough? Am I just unwanted?

I spiraled into depression. I started having intrusive thoughts that wouldn't go away. My grades suffered immediately. JEE, CET, Boards—I bombed everything. I studied like my life depended on it, but my brain wouldn't retain anything because it was too busy replaying her words over and over again.

I felt like I was drowning, and no one could save me.

## **Entry 11: The Decision to Disappear**
### *Post-Exam 2024 - Running Away*

I made a decision that was supposed to protect us both but ended up protecting nothing.

I thought, "If I study in the same city, the same college, we'll be uncomfortable. We'll run into each other. It will be awkward for her. So I'll just leave. I'll go abroad to study and remove myself from her life completely."

It made sense at the time. If I couldn't be with her, at least I could be far away from her. Out of sight. Out of mind. Hopefully, out of pain.

But even as I was making the decision, I felt like I was making a huge mistake. I felt like I was throwing something away that I might never get back. But I was too broken to think straight. I thought I was being noble, sacrificing my presence for her comfort.

Looking back, I know I was just running.

---

## **Entry 12: The Rebirth**
### *Late 2024 - Finding Myself Again*

Here's something I need to be honest about: I wasn't starting from zero when everything fell apart.

Before we ever started talking in that way—before the flirting, before the long conversations, before all of it—I was already taking care of myself. I was already reading, exercising, meditating, building good habits. I was already working on becoming a better version of myself. It was just part of who I was trying to be.

But after she broke me? After those four words destroyed everything? The intensity changed completely.

Now I wasn't just doing good habits. I was doing them with this raw, burning anger directed at myself. Every workout felt like punishment. Every book felt like self-correction. Every meditation felt like I was trying to forcefully erase her from my mind. I was channeling all that pain, all that rejection, all that self-doubt into these activities.

I was angry at myself for not being good enough. Angry at myself for letting her matter so much. Angry at myself for falling apart. And I used that anger as fuel. It became my motivation. It became my weapon against myself.

One day, I woke up and looked in the mirror and didn't recognize the person staring back. I was destroyed. But more importantly, I was furious—at myself, at the situation, at how much I had let her affect me.

I made a conscious decision: I couldn't live like this for the rest of my life. I had to change. I had to rebuild myself, not out of peace, but out of spite. Not just to function, but to prove something to myself—that I could survive this.

So I threw myself into working on myself with an intensity I'd never had before. The good habits became a battleground where I fought myself every single day. Reading. Exercising. Meditating. Taking care of my physical and mental health. It was brutal, painful, and exhausting—but this time it was fueled by anger and determination, not just discipline.

I never stopped loving her. Never stopped looking at her pictures. Never stopped hoping. But now I was also furious at myself for still doing these things. It was a complicated mess of emotion—love mixed with anger, hope mixed with self-criticism, care for her mixed with rage at myself.

I accepted that I had to live my life with or without her. But the acceptance came with a sharp edge of resentment directed inward.

## **Entry 13: The Attempt to Move Forward**
### *Late 2024 - The Seven-Day Experiment*

After a couple of months of working on myself, I thought I was ready for the next step. I thought I could move forward from her. Not move away, but move forward—create a life that didn't revolve entirely around her.

I tried. God, I tried so hard.

But I failed. Not once, not twice, but three to four times over several months. Each time, I'd be doing well, feeling strong, thinking I was finally getting over her. And then something would remind me of her—a song, a place, her Instagram story—and I'd come crashing back down.

This was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I've succeeded at difficult tasks before, but this? This was different. This was trying to unlove someone you love more than yourself.

I kept restarting. Kept trying. Kept failing. But I didn't give up.

---

## **Entry 14: The Unexpected Message**
### *Early 2025 - After 1.3+ Years of No Contact*

I was only seven days into one of my restarts when it happened.

Out of nowhere, after more than 1.3 years of silence, a message arrived—not from her, but from Krishna, a mutual friend. He told me she wanted to meet me. Just like that. After all this time, through someone else, came the message that shifted everything. The universe decided to flip my world upside down again.

The truth is, I wasn't protecting myself. In fact, I wanted to meet her so badly. But I had decided not to go because I was afraid—afraid I'd say something stupid, create a misunderstanding, confuse her, or make her feel bad. I didn't want my emotions to ruin anything.

But despite all of that, I gathered the courage to go. She had asked for me multiple times, and that meant something. And when I finally saw her, I could tell—she truly wanted to meet me.

---

## **Entry 15: The Reunion**
### *Early 2025 - Meeting Her Again*

When I saw her again, everything came flooding back. All the years. All the love. All the pain. It was all right there, threatening to consume me.

She asked me questions that stabbed right through my chest: "Why are you ignoring me?" "Why are you not talking to me?" "Not even a simple text?"

I couldn't speak. All I could do was breathe—long, deep, trembling sighs. I was so overwhelmed that words felt impossible. I later learned that my silence hurt her. She thought I wasn't interested anymore. She felt rejected by my very attempt to protect myself.

But then she started crying. Real tears. Tears that said more than any words could. She missed me. She really, genuinely missed me. Not just casually—but the way I had been missing her. She missed my love. She missed my care. She missed me.

In that moment, I felt everything shift. The rejection she'd given me wasn't about me not being enough. It was something else. Something I still don't fully understand, but I trust that there was a reason.

I put my hand on her back, and we sat there in silence for a while. Then we talked. Really talked. And when we parted that day, I felt like maybe, just maybe, I wasn't quite so broken anymore.

---

## **Entry 16: The Second Chance**
### 3 weeks before Present day - New Beginnings*

After that reunion, we started talking again. First on Instagram. Then we moved to WhatsApp. It's not much, but it feels significant. It feels like progress.

She told me something that I've been replaying in my mind ever since: "You're not unwanted."

Those five words did what six to eight months of self-work couldn't do. They made me believe, just a little bit, that maybe I was right to hold on all this time.

I can see it now—she wants to give me a second chance. She sees my care for her. She sees my love. And maybe, just maybe, she loves me too. Maybe she realized my worth. Maybe the time apart helped her understand what I've always known—that what we have is real and special and worth fighting for.

I still don't know what the future holds. I can't predict it or control it. But for the first time in a long time, I'm not just hoping anymore. I'm actually starting to believe.

This isn't the end of the story. This is just the beginning of a new chapter.
