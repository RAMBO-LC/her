so one year ago she got to know about the boys feelings but not through the boy but a mutual friend of both. so she decided to talk to him, and they talked for almost a year and though out the year that boy was not stable with his emotions and kept confessing her everyday but still girl didn't distant herself but her all friend approved him but still she distant herself due to family pressure to study 

but then after another year she wanted to meet the boy and they met and she started to say things like "why were you ignoring me", "why are you not seeing me" etc & boy just took heavy breaths to ignore giving heavy-emotional answers and eventually she cried and the boy wanted to hug her so bad but he didn't, instead he just patted her back but after some days the boy messaged her and said sorry for dodging to her questions and they started to talk again but this time the boy is calm, present, improved him physically-mentally-socially-skillwise, and admit his vulnerability to her but not too heavily, cause he has reflected his actions so many time and acknowledge his mistakes and his behaviour

she shares her her life too; recently she had a trip planned with her family and even when she was in her journey she talked to him, and when she returned and the boy asked about her trip she shared everything, photo, videos too
